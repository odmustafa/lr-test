Testing grounds for Left/Right artist website.

Here's what we talked about,
Please don't hesitate to ask me questions or if you need media / me to do something. 

## OUR CURRENT LAYOUT IDEA

Status | Page | Desc 
--- | --- | ---
in progress | Home | cool picture and links
in progress | Music | spotify background pic? and soundcloud widgets - features, mixes free downloads
in progress | Media | Press, instagram, press clips, and music videos
in progress | Merch | square site hosted or redirected
in progress | Tour | Bands in town or Songkick widget - research that
in progress | Contact | agent, mgmt, promos, socials

### Omar to do
- research a Wordpress template vs what we have...maybe send examples?
- if we proceed as-is adjust size of logo to somewhere between the two sizes we looked at
- try out icons at the bottom of home page... make them a little bigger than the phone version
- research press pics for media page...flickr vs hosting on site
- experiment with logo split in two on both sides 

### Chris to do
- generate videos for gifs - talk to taylor
- send pics
- pic out feeds for Media page (instagram, flickr / press clips)
- make a flickr stream
- write out my contact stuff
---
### stranger layout:
- Home - title page
- Music - Spotify and soundcloud
- Media - photos videos and flyers
- About - Bio
- Booking - Contact
- Merch -

# Couple other ideas:
we might want to include "time travel is not a crime" in the flashing for the logo on the home page at some point
and it's possible we might want an "about" page to include my bio... not sure where else to put it? we can link to my media assets there too.
